Description: The goal of 'BayesPower' is to provide tools for Bayesian sample size determination and power analysis across a range of common hypothesis testing scenarios using Bayes factors. The main function, BayesPower_BayesFactor(), launches an interactive 'shiny' application for performing these analyses. The application also provides command-line code for reproducibility. Details of the methods are described in the tutorial by Wong, Pawel, and Tendeiro (2025) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/pgdac_v1>.
